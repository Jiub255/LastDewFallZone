			"description": "You control a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. Original game I'm ripping off (Last Stand: Dead Zone) was a zombie apocalypse, but I wan't to do something different. Maybe some invasive alien wild animals we accidentally brought over and let loose. Want to eventually have access to scifi level technology.\n\nYou go out into the city to scavenge supplies and food and the such. \n\nYou can build buildings and fortifications to improve your base. \n\tMedical buildings to heal characters\n\tFarm plots/animal coops and water catchers for food/water.\n\tDefensive buildings like walls and towers and traps\n\tBeds and showers and other comfort things to improve morale\n\tArt and entertainment things to improve morale\n\tWorkbenches and the such, to build other things/buildings.\n\nYou can craft useful items\n\tWeapons, melee and ranged\n\tArmor, helmets, torso, legs, feet\n\tAccessories to improve stats, medical equipment, stealthy stuff, tech gadgets eventually.\n\tUsable items, painkillers, bandages, drugs to improve performance, etc\n\tComponents to craft more advanced things\n\tTools to craft other things with\n\nStat system\n\tInstead of basic hp, have a pain/injury system. Injury is how much actual damage your body has taken, and pain is how much it affects your mental state (which affects stats negatively). Pain raises 1:1 with injury level (100 is max, which is death or KO), but you can use painkillers to temporarily reduce the negative effects of pain. You can only heal injury level at home base, not while out scavenging. \n\t(Still not sure about exact stats to use yet)\n\tAttack\n\tDefense (or just get these 2 from equipment?)\n\tScavenging\n\tEngineering\n\tFarming\n\tMedical\n\tStealth? (For possible noise stat that attracts enemies, guns and cars are very loud)\n\nMorale system\n\tThe team as a whole has a morale stat, which (negatively or positively) affects the stats of every character. It'll be on a -100 to 100 scale. Morale is affected by many things, like\n\tFood/Water levels\n\tComfort levels (enough beds, showers, entertainment, art, plants, etc)\n\tTotal injury level of team?\n\tRecent deaths on team?\n\tFinding a really good secret loot spot\n\tBuilding an important new building\n\tMorale menu to show all the factors\n\nScavenging system\n\tNot sure how to choose scavenging location yet. Maybe just a map like LS:DZ. Or maybe a \"overworld\" mini-game where you walk/drive around the city and find a place. Different events could happen on the overworld map to keep it interesting: ambushes, mobs, special events. \n\tWhen you get to the spot, your team goes around and you loot what you can while fighting off enemies. Maybe more come the longer you stay so you eventually get overwhelmed and have to leave or die? Don't do a timer, that's no fun and doesn't make sense. Or maybe the \"flow\" of enemies varies? Like sometimes  you get overwhelmed and sometimes it's just mellow.\n\tIf a pc gets to 100 injury, they become incapacitated and have to recover for a good while back home. Not sure if they'll be killable yet. Maybe kinda like d&d with the death saving throws, like you can be killed once you're incapacitated so protect that pc well. \n\tSometimes you can meet other pcs and they'll join the team if you save them or whatever. Could be special event things.\n\nHome Base\n\tStarts simple, maybe just a hollowed out warehouse or something. Might have multiple to choose from, different themes and such. And maybe later in the game you can find better places like prisons to move into. \n\tYou slowly build up your base with scavenged/produced items. \n\tOccasionally you get invaded by enemies (human \"bandit\" types and/or other enemies). Combat is the same as when you're scavenging, except you can use your defensive buildings.\n\tOccasionally a random new pc will wander to your base and join you. Can also find new pcs out in the field. \n\n",

Also, how do they level?\nHow to level pcs?\n\tAutomatically/randomly?\n\tOr manually, using some skill point system?\n\tCould mix the two, have it so you can rank each pc's stats 1 - 6 (or however many).

Maybe each pc comes with their rankings randomized and you can change them to suit your needs if you want.\nFor now, just gonna give exp to the pc that does the thing. I guess just give the exp for killing enemies to whoever delivers the final blow. Or do it based on damage/percent of total life taken? \nHave exp number popups every time someone gets exp.",

			"description": "GOOD ENOUGH FOR NOW. Ended up disabling collision and avoidance on enemies, and just having them go 4 to a pc, one on each side. Might change it up later.\n\nEnabling avoidance makes them avoid each other, but they push and slide each other out of the way to get to a shared target. Want to find a way to have new characters approach from a free side, without nudging other characters, or just choose a new target if this one is 'full' of attackers.\nPut preset \"combat slots\" around each character that get filled with attackers during combat? To help with too many combat characters pushing and sliding each other around while fighting.\nOr maybe just use a grid for movement/combat?\nTry slots thing first. Start with four, one on each side. If all slots are full of attackers, others just find a different target or wait.  And if a slot is blocked by a wall or something, temporarily disable it. \n\nEach PC has four CombatSlots (with Node3D and occupied bool).\nFor enemy to find a target, they search each pc closest to farthest.\nSearch each slot, if it's not occupied, that slot/PC is the target.\nEnemy has a EnemyTarget (with PC and CombatSlot)\n\nMaybe don't use MoveAndSlide()? Probably the source of all the pushing/sliding.\n\nMaybe don't use CharacterBody3D, might not even need collisions if using navigation agents properly. Just have it pathfind around obstacles, and head to attack position instead of directly to player/enemy. Or just stop a certain distance from their target. \n\nChanging Avoidance layer/mask to 2 on PC, and lowering the avoidance radius from 0.5 to 0.25 on Enemy has helped, but still has awkward crowding and spinning. \nChanging \"Time Horizon Agents\" to 10 seconds helped too. Still wonky though.\nMaybe change the player attack directions to be absolute, and not depend on the pc's' facing direction?\n\nCurrently trying putting nav obstacles on the enemy and rebaking / repathing every few seconds. Not working well at all so far, very slow and weird things are happening. Probably because the agent is always inside of its own obstacle?\n\nOr maybe just do it like LSDZ and let enemies overlap. Makes for scarier swarms too. And way easier.\nJust use avoidance on enemies (different avoidance layer than pcs), and have them run at the nearest target. ",

			"description": "Is the (long UID, Craftable craftable) dictionary necessary? Can just use GD.Load(uid). But even on craftables, which hold uids for other craftables (required materials, etc.)?\nIt's used so that craftable resources don't have to hold references to a bunch of other craftables, they just store a long UID, then look up the craftable in the database. Also used in the custom resource editor.\n\nBasically is it better to keep all craftables in a dict in memory, or just load them in as needed? Probably fine to just load them in, unless it's noticeably slow. Especially if gonna have hundreds of craftables.\nAlso, UIDs might not be stable in actual builds, not 100% sure about how this works. I think the build keeps a UID cache so it can locate resources from UIDs, but you can't get the UID from the resource at runtime. Might not matter in this case. \nCould just write a script that goes through all the craftables folders and auto creates a static class full of \"public const string CRAFTABLE_NAME = [craftable uid]\". Then loading any resource is easily done using GD.Load(uid). \nCurrently using the Craftables resource for the resource editor.\nReally depends on how the craftables need to be accessed.\nIf need to have them all/iterate over them, the current system, or even just an array, could work.\nFor getting them by name, the static class works well. Better than a <string, Craftable> dict, except can't iterate. But will they ever need to be retrieved by name? Or is it all either random loot, or items stored by uid in inventory?\nLoot will be random, based on item tags/rarity, so it'll need access to the whole database, along with those two properties at least. Or maybe just have a list of long uids, grouped by item tag and rarity. Then the loot container can just choose from whatever categories and then load the actual resources from those uids. Easy enough to create a script to do that. Just put each subcategory into its own array, like common medical, rare combat, etc. Can deal with duplicates from multiple tags too. \nOr could just load up the whole database, then populate each loot container in the world using that, but only store the uids. Only needed once on new game. Or could maybe do before each scavenging run? Depends on how big the database gets. \n\nFor now, keeping the database for the resource editor, and probably for random loot too. If it becomes too big in memory then we'll figure something out. Might make it only load up while populating random loot containers, either once for the whole city on new game, or just each time you go scavenging. Might keep it in memory at home base too, to know what can be crafted/built.",

Maybe just use signals for when its hard to unsubscribe properly. \n\nTrying to unsubscribe from events in ExitTree() doesn't work for anything involving children, since they have all already exited the tree. And a lot of events involve connecting to child nodes. \nPlus, godot handles disconnection automatically, so less to worry about. Hopefully this will avoid memory leaks. \nCan't be done from non-variant classes or with non-variant parameters. Can inherit from RefCounted to make a plain c# class into a variant, but then the standard JSON serialization doesn't work.\nMight just learn to serialize Variants in the save system to allow for more signals instead of events.\nProblem is sending signals from c# classes that already inherit some other c# thing, like IEnumberable<T>.
